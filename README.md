# Gradient Descent and Linear Regression

This notebook focuses on the implementation of Gradient Descent, Mean Squared Error, Linear Regression, Partial Derivatives, and Theta Corrections using Partial Derivatives.

## Topics Covered:

1. **Gradient Descent**: Implementation of the optimization algorithm to minimize the cost function.
2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Calculation of the MSE as the cost function to be minimized.
3. **Linear Regression**: Development of a linear regression model for predictive analysis.
4. **Partial Derivatives**: Understanding and computation of partial derivatives for each parameter.
5. **Theta Corrections**: Application of the partial derivatives to adjust the theta parameters in the model.

## Note:

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing essential concepts in machine learning, specifically in the context of linear regression and gradient descent. The focus is on the mathematical aspects, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying principles.

Feel free to explore the code and accompanying explanations to gain insights into the mechanics of these fundamental machine learning concepts.
